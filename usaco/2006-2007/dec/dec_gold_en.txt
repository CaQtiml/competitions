                  Three problems numbered 1 through 3
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: Wormholes [J. Kuipers, 2002]

While exploring his many farms, Farmer John has discovered a number
of amazing wormholes. A wormhole is very peculiar because it is a
one-way path that delivers you to its destination at a time that
is BEFORE you entered the wormhole! Each of FJ's farms comprises N
(1 <= N <= 500) fields conveniently numbered 1..N, M (1 <= M <=
2500) paths, and W (1 <= W <= 200) wormholes.

As FJ is an avid time-traveling fan, he wants to do the following:
start at some field, travel through some paths and wormholes, and
return to the starting field a time before his initial departure.
Perhaps he will be able to meet himself :) .

To help FJ find out whether this is possible or not, he will supply
you with complete maps to F (1 <= F <= 5) of his farms.  No paths
will take longer than 10,000 seconds to travel and no wormhole can
bring FJ back in time by more than 10,000 seconds.

PROBLEM NAME: wormhole

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, F. F farm descriptions follow.

* Line 1 of each farm: Three space-separated integers respectively: N,
        M, and W

* Lines 2..M+1 of each farm: Three space-separated numbers (S, E, T)
        that describe, respectively: a bidirectional path between S
        and E that requires T seconds to traverse. Two fields might be
        connected by more than one path.

* Lines M+2..M+W+1 of each farm: Three space-separated numbers (S, E,
        T) that describe, respectively: A one way path from S to E
        that also moves the traveler back T seconds.

INPUT DETAILS:

Two farm maps. The first has three paths and one wormhole, and the
second has two paths and one wormhole.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..F: For each farm, output "YES" if FJ can achieve his goal,
        otherwise output "NO" (do not include the quotes).

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file wormhole.out):

NO
YES

OUTPUT DETAILS:

For farm 1, FJ cannot travel back in time.
For farm 2, FJ could travel back in time by the cycle 1->2->3->1, arriving
back at his starting location 1 second before he leaves. He could start
from anywhere on the cycle to accomplish this.

Problem 2: The Fewest Coins [Carl Hultquist, 2006]

Farmer John has gone to town to buy some farm supplies. Being a
very efficient man, he always pays for his goods in such a way that
the smallest number of coins changes hands, i.e., the number of
coins he uses to pay plus the number of coins he receives in change
is minimized. Help him to determine what this minimum number is.

FJ wants to buy T (1 <= T <= 10,000) cents of supplies.  The currency
system has N (1 <= N <= 100) different coins, with values V1, V2,
..., VN (1 <= Vi <= 120). Farmer John is carrying C1 coins of value
V1, C2 coins of value V2, ...., and CN coins of value VN (0 <= Ci
<= 10,000). The shopkeeper has an unlimited supply of all the coins,
and always makes change in the most efficient manner (although
Farmer John must be sure to pay in a way that makes it possible to
make the correct change).

PROBLEM NAME: fewcoins

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and T.

* Line 2: N space-separated integers, respectively V1, V2, ..., VN
        coins (V1...VN).

* Line 3: N space-separated integers, respectively C1, C2, ..., CN

SAMPLE INPUT (file fewcoins.in):

3 70
5 25 50
5 2 1


INPUT DETAILS:

Farmer John has 5x5 cent coins, 2x25 cent coins and 1x50 cent coin.
His bill is 70 cents.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A line containing a single integer, the minimum number of
        coins involved in a payment and change-making. If it is
        impossible for Farmer John to pay and receive exact change,
        output -1.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file fewcoins.out):

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Farmer John pays 75 cents using a 50 cents and a 25 cents coin, and
receives a 5 cents coin in change, for a total of 3 coins used in
the transaction.

Problem 3: Milk Patterns [Coaches, 2004]

Farmer John has noticed that the quality of milk given by his cows
varies from day to day. On further investigation, he discovered
that although he can't predict the quality of milk from one day to
the next, there are some regular patterns in the daily milk quality.

To perform a rigorous study, he has invented a complex classification
scheme by which each milk sample is recorded as an integer between
0 and 1,000,000 inclusive, and has recorded data from a single cow
over N (1 <= N <= 20,000) days. He wishes to find the longest
pattern of samples which repeats identically at least K (2 <= K <= N) times.
This may include overlapping patterns -- 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 1 repeats 2
3 2 3 twice, for example.

Help Farmer John by finding the longest repeating subsequence in
the sequence of samples. It is guaranteed that at least one subsequence
is repeated at least K times.

PROBLEM NAME: patterns

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K

* Lines 2..N+1: N integers, one per line, the quality of the milk on
        day i appears on the ith line.
