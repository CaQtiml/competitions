Competitive programming

Here you can find my solutions to various problems I solved as a high school student to prepare for the [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/). The aim of this repository is to stand as a reference to current high school students training for the same kind of competitions.

All of the solutions (if not indicated otherwise) have been tested as correct.
